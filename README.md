# Governance, Risk and Compliance Notes üìú

This repository contains my progress reports and learning notes from my internship in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). It documents what I‚Äôve learned throughout my journey, including key concepts, case studies, and insights related to cybersecurity governance and organizational security practices.

The goal of this repo is not only to track my personal growth but also to help others who are interested in exploring the GRC field within cybersecurity. Hopefully, it serves as a useful resource for beginners wanting to understand how GRC connects technical security measures with business objectives ‚öñÔ∏è.
