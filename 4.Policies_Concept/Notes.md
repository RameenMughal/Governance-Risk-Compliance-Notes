- **Rule** -> Mandatory to do
- **Policy**
  - Statements to achieve specific goal.
  - Set of ideas or plans that is used for making decisions, especially in politics, economics or businesses.
  - Mostly in management team so the this team needs to be serious about Information Security.
- **Policy in GRC**
  - Formal statement of intent or rule that guides decisions and behavior within an organization.
  - In GRC, policies are the foundation for ensuring governance consistency, risk management, and compliance with laws or standards (e.g. ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR).
- Then rules are made after policy to achieve that goal.
- Example -> The policy is to make data private so the rule will be enforced like one employee cannot use another employee's computer.
- Flat Network
  - Everything is connected together with no barriers.
  - No VLANs
  - There should not be a flat network in organization as it has risk (attacker can cause malware to come in and organization's network will be compromised).
  - There should be different networks among organizations like divided in departments.
- **Difference between Policy and Framework?**
  - Policy -> Set of mandatory rules or principles that defines the goals and desired outcomes.
  - Framework -> Provides the structure, tools and guidance for implementing those policies
