# Audit

- Auditor and Auditee (Company)
- The company assures its users and customers that it is reliable by conducting regular audits.
- An audit checks how well a company follows standards, policies, and regulations.
- We will discuss IT (Information Technology) and IS (Information Security) Audits here.
- State Bank of Pakistan says that both Internal and External Audit should be done
  - Internally like monthly or twice a year.
  - Externally like once a year.
- If one statement in the policy says "Password should be strong", this is general policy and has ambiguity. Then ask the company what standards they follow (e.g. NIST)

## Types of Audit

### 1. Internal Audit

- **Conducted by**: Employees or an internal audit team
- **Purpose**:
  - Check internal processes, controls, and compliance
  - Identify weaknesses before external auditors do
- **Example**: Reviewing access controls or backup procedures

### 2. External Audit

- **Conducted by**: Independent third-party auditors
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate compliance with laws, standards, or regulations
  - Provide assurance to stakeholders, regulators, or customers
- **Example**: ISO 27001 certification audit
- More preferable as it ensures customer satisfaction

### 3. Compliance Audit

- **Focus**: Ensuring the organization follows specific laws, regulations, or standards
- **Example**: GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA audits

## Step by Step Guide For Conducting a Security Audit

### 1. Scope of the Audit

- **Define the audit scope**: Decide what systems, processes, or departments will be reviewed.
- **Keep the scope narrow**: Focus on critical areas to ensure depth and effectiveness.
- **Duration**: Audits usually take 2 to 3 months depending on size and complexity.

### 2. Review Current Security Policies

- Check existing policies to see if they are up-to-date, effective, and compliant with standards and regulations.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Access control policies
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Incident response plans
  - Data protection and privacy policies
- **Outcome**: Identify gaps, weaknesses, or outdated policies that need improvement.

### 3. Assess Technical Controls

- **Definition**: Evaluate whether the technical security mechanisms (access controls, firewalls, encryption, authentication systems) are implemented correctly and working effectively.
- Best practice is to first read the policies and then test the controls.
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure systems are protected from unauthorized access or attacks
  - Identify gaps, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities
- **Outcome**:
  - Identify weaknesses and recommend improvements
  - Ensure compliance with standards and policies

### 4. Test Control Effectiveness

- **Definition**: Verify that the implemented controls (technical, administrative, or physical) actually work as intended.
- **Purpose**:
  - Confirm that security measures are effective and reliable
  - Identify gaps, weaknesses, or failures in controls
  - Ensure compliance with policies, standards, and regulations
- **Outcome**:
  - Recommendations for improving controls
  - Evidence for audit reporting
 
### 5. Compile and Analyze Findings

- **Definition**: Collect all the observations, test results, and evidence from the audit and analyze them to identify gaps, weaknesses, and compliance issues.
- **Purpose**:
  - Summarize the audit results clearly
  - Highlight areas of non-compliance or risk
  - Provide actionable recommendations for improvement
  - Support decision-making by management and executives
- **Importance in GRC**:
  - The final report is submitted to top management
  - Drives policy changes, security improvements, and compliance actions
  - Forms the basis for future risk assessments and audits

### 6. Create a Comprehensive Report

- **Purpose**: Document audit scope, findings, and recommendations.
- **Contents**: Key findings, risks, charts/graphs, and action plans.
- **Outcome**: Gives management a clear overview for decisions.

### 7. Present Findings to Stakeholders

- **Purpose**: Share audit results clearly to support decision-making.
- **How**:
  - Use charts and graphs (bar, pie, trend) to show risks and gaps
  - Summarize key findings and recommended actions
- **Outcome**: Stakeholders quickly understand risks and decide on improvement

### 8. Plan for Follow-Up

- **Purpose**: Ensure that audit recommendations are implemented and improvements are made.
- **How**:
  - Track corrective actions for each finding
  - Set deadlines and assign responsible teams
  - Schedule follow-up reviews or audits to verify compliance
- **Outcome**: Risks are mitigated, and controls are strengthened
