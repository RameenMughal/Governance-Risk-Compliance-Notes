# Gap Assessment

## Understanding Gap Analysis

- Gap analysis is the process of measuring the difference between a company's present operations (current state) and its ideal performance (desired state).

- Difference between Audit and Gap Analysis?
  - Audit -> Evaluation to check whether an organization meets specific standards, policies, or regulations. It focuses on compliance.
  - Gap Analysis -> Comparative assessment used to identify the “gap” between the current state and the desired or required state. It focuses on improvements.
- Report
  - Executive Summary of Gap Analysis document
  - To be checked mainly by managers.

- Conducting a Gap Analysis is generally less expensive than performing an Audit Readiness assessment because it focuses only on identifying gaps, whereas Audit Readiness requires deeper verification, documentation review, and evidence collection.
- The more security is applied, the more complex operations becomes.

- Step 4 (Implementing the Action Plan) typically takes the most time because many organizations are hesitant to invest heavily in security tools and device protection.
- During the implementation of the Action Plan, an **Action Implementation Tracker** should be maintained to record progress, monitor deadlines, and ensure that each control or task is completed effectively.
- When the gaps are identified, then prioritise the which process needs to be completed first based on severity (critical, medium or low).

## Example: How to Conduct ISO 27001 Gap Analysis

1. Download a copy of the ISO 27001 Standard.
2. Assess your business processes and practices to determine how well they align with the required controls.
3. Create a plan to close the gaps.

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
  - Network of servers around the world that deliver your website’s content faster and more securely to users.
  - Instead of every user connecting directly to your main server, they connect to the nearest CDN server.
- **Third-party Sellers** - External sellers who are not part of the company but use the company’s platform to sell their products.
