- Step 4 (Implementing the Action Plan) typically takes the most time because many organizations are hesitant to invest heavily in security tools and device protection.
- During the implementation of the Action Plan, an **Action Implementation Tracker** should be maintained to record progress, monitor deadlines, and ensure that each control or task is completed effectively.
- When the gaps are identified, then prioritise the which process needs to be completed first based on severity (critical, medium or low).
