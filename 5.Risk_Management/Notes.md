## Understanding Risk Management

- Risk management is all about understanding how much risk you can tolerate.
- Risks should be reduced to a level that is acceptable or tolerable for the organization.
- Process of identifying, assessing, treating, and monitoring risks that could negatively impact an organization’s objectives, operations, or reputation.
- In cybersecurity and GRC, it ensures that security threats, compliance gaps, and operational vulnerabilities are managed proactively and systematically.

### Steps of Risk Management Process

1. Identify Potential Risks
2. Analysing the Risk
3. Evaluating the Risk
4. Treating the Risk
5. Monitoring and Reviewing the Risk

## Understanding Risk Assessment

- Aims to identify quantify and prioritize risks against criteria for risk acceptance and IS (Information Security) objective.
- Risk assessment helps find risks, measure how serious they are, and decide which ones need attention based on what the organization wants to protect and what level of risk it can accept.
- It helps choose the right actions to reduce or manage risks so the organization can achieve its goals.

## Understanding Asset Identification

- Asset → Anything valuable to an organization that needs protection.
- If it supports business operations or has value, it is an asset.
- Assets can be:
  - Physical Assets: Laptops, Servers, Buildings and more.
  - Digital Assets: Databases, Software, Source Code and more.
  - People: Employees, Managers, Security Staffs and more.
  - Information: Customer data, Financial Records, Passwords and more.
  - Services: Internet access, Email services, Cloud systems and more.
  - Premises: Office buildings, Data Centers, Warehouses and more.
- Asset identification is necessary because you cannot protect what you don’t know exists.

### Flow of Identification

- Asset Identification → Threat Identification → Vulnerability Identification → Control Identification

1. **Asset Identification**: Process of finding and listing all valuable items within an organization.
2. **Threat Identification**: Focuses on determining all possible events that could harm an asset.
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: Weaknesses that make an asset vulnerable to threats.
4. **Control Identification**: Safeguards or countermeasures used to reduce or eliminate risks.

## Understanding Risk Analysis

- Risk Analysis is the process of examining identified risks to understand:
  - How likely they are to happen
  - How severe their impact would be
  - How they affect the organization
- It helps organizations determine the level of risk so they can prioritize which risks need immediate attention.
- General Formula: Level of risk = impact x likelihood

### Types of Risk Analysis 

1. **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: Uses descriptive ratings instead of numbers.
   - Examples:
     - Likelihood: Low / Medium / High
     - Impact: Minor / Moderate / Critical
2. **Quantitative Risk Analysis**
   - Examples:
     - Probability values (0.1, 0.8, etc.)
     - Financial impact (e.g., loss = $20,000)

1. **Avoidance**: Proactive Approach that involves avoiding actions or decisions that could potentially introduce risks to the organization.
2. **Mitigation**: Requires implementing measures to decrease the likelihood or impact of the risks.
3. **Acceptance**: Strategic choice made with the understanding that some level of risks is unavoidable in pursuing business objectives.
4. **Transference**: Involves shifting the potential impact of a risk to a third party like insurance.

- After treatment, continuous monitoring is necessary to check if the risk exists or not.
