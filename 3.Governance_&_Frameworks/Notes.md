# Governance and Frameworks

- What is Governance?
  - You set rules to achieve a specific goal.
  - What rules are set and how are you going to achieve that goal.

- Governance is important in GRC.
- If no governing body then there will be no risk management and no compliance.
- Governing body and management body are different.
  - Governing body provides strategic direction, sets policies, and ensures the organization fulfills its mission.
  - Management body handles day-to-day operations and implements the decisions made by the governing body.

- Management is about executing the tasks and tell the team to work on a specific tasks
- Governance is about performance monitoring, it checks the status of the work and how business and people are operating and what can be the next steps to achive the goals.

- Corporate governance deals with business.
- IT governance deals with Information Technology stuff.

- Previously IT (Information Technology) Governance and IS (Information Security) Governance was dealt under the IT Governance team but had major conflict of interest.
- IS Governance checks who should have access or not.
- IT Governance checks about the system on how to deploy and function it.

- Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC)
  - It is the core governing body
  - It ensures alignment between business, technology and compliance
  - It ensures that information systems support business goals, are secure, and deliver value effectively.

- Informatioin Technology Steering Committee (ITSC)
  - Governing body that provides strategic direction, oversight, and governance for all IT-related activities within an organization.
  - It ensures that IT investments, projects, and policies align with business goals and deliver value effectively.

- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
  - Acts as the bridge between technical teams and business leadership.
  - Presents security updates, risks, and KPIs to the board.
  - If an attack is occured, usually CISO takes the responsibility.

- Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
  - Senior executive responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing all risks that could affect the organization
  - Including financial, operational, strategic, cybersecurity, and compliance risks.

- All the security report goes to CISO or CRO as it decides on what to do next.
- It only reports the system is secure or not and then it is the system's owner choice to make it secure or not.
- Governing body checks all the risk estimates including AI, mobile applications, websites etc.
- Frameworks ensure that the Governing body is strong.

### Task: Build Governance Structure

**Scenario**: You’ve joined a small fintech startup that has no formal InfoSec governance structure. Your task is to propose a basic governance model, define:
- Who is responsible for what (CISO, IT, Risk Team, etc.)
- What key documents or processes should exist (policies, risk register, reporting, etc.)
- How you’ll ensure accountability and compliance.
