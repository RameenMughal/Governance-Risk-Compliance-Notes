# Information Security Fundamentals Notes

- Difference between Information Security and Cybersecurity?
    - Information Security is about protecting information, it consists of all types of security.
    - Cybersecurity is about protecting that comes under the digital space (that is done digitally).

- GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance)
  - Human Incentive
  - More Human Interaction
  - It is a critical domain in Information Security

- Governance - Builds up the structure of the company.
- Business is mostly involved with GRC.
- PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment) -> A privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a method for identifying and assessing privacy risks throughout the development lifecycle of a program or system.
- Why GRC? - Must have standards as customers will not trust the business where there are no standards.
- By having standards, it will assure that the business comply to the standards.
- In case of any attack, business will also not face high penalty as it has standards and rules.
- Frameworks and standards don't 100% guarantee that there will be no attacks or security breach.
- Why GRC developed? -> There was no coordination between teams in the business to know the updates about each teams.
- Through GRC, there will be coordination and collaboration through GRC.

 - CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
    - Confidentiality -> Protect the information and give right access to the right person (can be checked through Encryption).
    - Integrity -> Consistent and right data (can be checked through hashing).
    - Availability -> How much is the response (can be checked by preventing from DDoS Attack).

- Vulnerability - Weekness of a system or human that the attacker can exploit.
- Threat - Possibility that the attacker can do this attack.
- Risk - Analyze what can be the impact if the vulnerability is exploited by the attacker
- Risk = Threat x Impact
- Attack Vector -> Entry point or starting point on where the attack happened and how.

### Task 

Choose any case study from the year 2020, research about it and identify what CIA element was compromised, what was the Attack Vector and what security measures did the business make on response of the attack.
