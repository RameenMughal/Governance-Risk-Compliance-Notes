# Incident Response and Business Continuity

- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan is important in every organization and environment.
- Mostly both Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan ahave same document as they both complement each other but are not the same.
- Incident Response Plan have separate document.
- **Example: When a fire erupts**
  - **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: Defines how to respond immediately to the fire when it occurs (e.g., evacuation, alerting emergency services, isolating affected areas).
  - **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**: Explains how to recover or restore damaged materials, systems, or data after the fire
(e.g., restoring backups, repairing infrastructure).
  - **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Describes how to keep the business running during and after the fire
(e.g., shifting operations to an alternate site, remote work).

## Incident Response Plan

- An Incident Response Plan (IRP) → Documented, structured approach that an organization follows to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents, such as cyberattacks, data breaches, malware infections, or system outages.
- Prepared in advance to clearly define how to respond when a security incident or attack occurs.
- It is proactive meaning it is created in advance before the incident.
- IRP is a detailed, documented plan for handling incidents.

### Phases of NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

- There is no guidance for developing the Incident Response Plan but NIST shows the Lifecycle of Incident Response Plan.

#### 1. Preparation

- Identify critical systems and plan to protect them
- What to identify critical or not? It depends on the organization or company.
- Develop use cases and playbooks to define step-by-step actions for responding to different types of incidents or disasters.
- Use Cases → Describe scenarios of potential incidents and their impact.
- Playbooks → Step-by-step procedures to handle each scenario.

#### 2. Detection and Analysis

- Detect the incident and cause behind the incident.
- It can take time to detect the incident (e.g. The ransomware was in the computer for long time but detected it now).
- Note down the detection tools while detection and analysis.

#### 3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery

- **Containment**: 

## Disaster Recovery Plan

- A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) → Documented strategy that explains how an organization will restore critical systems, data, and IT operations after a major disruptive event, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, hardware failures, or power outages.
- It is created before an incident to ensure quick recovery of IT systems after a disaster.
- It is proactive meaning it is created in advance before the incident.
- Disaster can be natural or man-made.

## Business Continuity Plan

- A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) → Documented strategy that ensures critical business operations continue during and after a disruption or disaster.
- BCP is business-focused rather than IT-focused
- First, identify the systems that the business depends on and mark them as critical; then plan measures to ensure these systems continue operating even if a disaster occurs.
